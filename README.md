# Overview

I created a credit card validator which uses Luhn's algorithm to check whether a card is valid or not.

# Development Environment

I wrote the program using C++ and included the <iostream> and <list> libraries.

# Future Work

- Create print statements that explain why the credit card was invalid
- Using a random number generator use Luhn's algorithm to find a valid credit card number
